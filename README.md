From sample pack creation and algorithmic composition to AI text-to-audio and onscreen ChatGPT, Soundstorm is a sonic powerhouse.

### Features

- üéµ **AI Text-to-Audio Generation**: Generate any song or sound you want by a simple text prompt.
- üì¶ **Algorithmic Sample Pack Creation**: Automatically generate sample packs based on user-defined criteria.
- üéõ **Audio Effects**: Real-time audio effects like reverb, distortion, and more.
- üé∂ **Algorithmic Composition**: Create algorithmic composition.
- üéπ **MIDI Randomizer**: Generate random MIDI sequences for creative inspiration.
- üó®Ô∏è **Chat with GPT**: Integrated chat using OpenAI's GPT models for real-time conversational experiences.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11

### Install Dependencies

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. Run the following command to install all the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pedalboard pydub replicate midiutil soundfile openai numpy pygame
```

### API Keys

You'll need to have API keys for both Replicate and OpenAI:

- For Replicate, sign up at: https://replicate.com and follow the instructions to get your API key.
- For OpenAI, sign up at: https://openai.com/product and follow the instructions to get your API key.

Add these keys in the appropriate sections within the application before running it.

### Running the Application

After installing the prerequisites and obtaining the API keys, you can run the application using:

```bash
python Soundstorm.py
```

### Important

This is SUPER rough. Currently, it only exists as a Python script and has only been tested on 2 different Macs. It is more or less a working prototype with a super stripped-down GUI. It can be buggy and does require finagling. Also things definitely need to be cleaned up, labeled better, etc etc. I could use assistance with this!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is the work of an amateur. Would love to see it fleshed out!
